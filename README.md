# vortex-theme



## About vortex

The vortex theme will be the new standard in O3-Shop LTS. The vortex them will be 99% compatible to the primer wave theme. Mainly user might only need to change any references to the older theme name.

So backward compat was the main issue in mind. As such we use still smarty on the server. The template structure is based on wave, also alomost all block-names will be the same.

## But vortex is a lot more

- we are based on Bootstrap 5
- we will use SCSS/SASS
- Typescript is the default
- so fully responsive
- vortex is full-width by default but can also support boxed models if needed
- most of the needed javascripts will be done by swipper.js
- anyway we will provide jQuery in a child-theme. This is ONLY for existing plugins or child-themes to have a legacy enviroment.
- we provide grunt task for development, build and deployment
- and we use webpack be on board from the beginning

## Our full feature list (still under development)

- modern templates for landing pages (incl. frontpage), product lists, product details, cart, checkout, account
- off canvas mode for cart, filters, menues and search
- icon-sets (fa svg-icons, inline-svg)
- schema.org support as json-ld
- menu features (mega-menu, sticky, burger with off canvas)
